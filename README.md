## X25519 Dart Implementation üîê

### Overview

This Dart repository implements the X25519 key exchange algorithm as outlined in [RFC 7748](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7748). X25519 is a state-of-the-art method for secure key exchange, enabling two parties to establish a shared secret over an insecure channel.

### X25519

X25519 uses elliptic curve cryptography for key agreement and is known for its high security and performance. It is a default choice in various cryptographic protocols, including Transport Layer Security (TLS) and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec).

#### Key Features:
- **Strong Security**: Resistant to many known types of cryptographic attacks.
- **Efficient Performance**: Optimized for fast computations, even on platforms without cryptographic hardware acceleration.
- **Simplicity**: Has a straightforward implementation with reduced risk of critical vulnerabilities.

#### Best Practices:
- Always generate fresh private keys using a cryptographically secure random number generator.
- Never reuse private keys and always verify public keys before use.

### Background and History

Developed by Daniel J. Bernstein, X25519 is an evolution in the field of elliptic curve cryptography, focusing on security, simplicity, and performance.

### RFC 7748

RFC 7748 serves as a comprehensive guide for the X25519 algorithm, detailing its implementation, usage, and security considerations. This standardization ensures consistent and secure usage across various cryptographic systems.

## Usage Examples

### Real-World Use Case: Secure Messaging

**Scenario**: Implementing end-to-end encrypted messaging using X25519.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:x25519_dart/x25519.dart';

Uint8List alicePrivateKey = X25519.generatePrivateKey();
Uint8List alicePublicKey = X25519.generatePublicKey(alicePrivateKey);

Uint8List bobPrivateKey = X25519.generatePrivateKey();
Uint8List bobPublicKey = X25519.generatePublicKey(bobPrivateKey);

Uint8List aliceSharedSecret = X25519.computeSharedSecret(alicePrivateKey, bobPublicKey);
Uint8List bobSharedSecret = X25519.computeSharedSecret(bobPrivateKey, alicePublicKey);

// aliceSharedSecret and bobSharedSecret can be used for encrypting messages.
```

### Real-World Use Case: Secure File Transfer

**Scenario**: Securing file transfer between two parties.

```dart
import 'dart:typed_data';
import 'package:x25519_dart/x25519.dart';

// Alice generates her keys
Uint8List alicePrivateKey = X25519.generatePrivateKey();
Uint8List alicePublicKey = X25519.generatePublicKey(alicePrivateKey);

// Bob uses Alice's public key to encrypt a file
Uint8List bobPrivateKey = X25519.generatePrivateKey();
Uint8List sharedSecret = X25519.computeSharedSecret(bobPrivateKey, alicePublicKey);

// Use sharedSecret to encrypt the file before sending to Alice
```
